# Jr. System Administrator (Associate Solutions Engineer) Homework

Please read the instructions and questions carefully. This is an open-book assignment, so feel free to use your highly honed Google-Fu skills, but please don't copy the work of others or have anyone else help you. The entire team will evaluate your homework, which means you are free to use acronyms and technical/industry-specific language where appropriate and expedient.

Create/open a plain .txt file and answer the following:

1. Research a topic in IT where you are not an expert (20 minutes or so). When finished, write a summary paragraph that explains the topic so a non-technical person could understand.

2. What was the last thing you automated/scripted? If you havenâ€™t automated anything, what is something you would like to? Explain to us how you automated the task or a high-level overview of how you would. The automation does not need to be tied directly to your current job; this can include those pet projects you have in your home lab.

Please do not include anything in your homework submission (other than your name as the zip file) that could identify you. Submissions are anonymized on receipt so our team does not know whose homework they are evaluating.
